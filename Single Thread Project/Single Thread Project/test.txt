not quite ready just yet, but starting migrations in January. 
Right now just trying to keep old SCCM alive for those who currently use it.
What we can do is something interesting. Not using uvuid for accounts, using SA accounts created for themselves. Nate Wetton is the
person you would want to talk to with that. Also will need an AD group created with all of our SA accounts created in it.
Once Nate has done that let him know the name of the group that he's made for us. then he'll start getting us rights. Then start
modifying smart deploy image to deploy devices into MECM simple as a script that I would put in as an application. Then anytime we 
image with smart deploy it will put the MECM client on there. Any existing devices we'd have to make sure that they're not pointing 
towards WSUS server anymore because we dont want it to fight with MECM. If any have old SCCM client on it we will need a script to switch
it over to the new one. Any of the devices we enroll can set up a policy that would do that, once we have the actual rights to do stuff
we can look into doing that. Can do some testing throughout december, but wont be ready until bulk.
